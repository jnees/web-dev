# web-dev-for-fun
A collection of web development projects that I've built for practice, tutorials, or just for fun.

3. ## [Crypto-Converter](https://github.com/jnees/web-dev-for-fun/tree/master/Bitcoin-Ticker)

This web app lets you get the latest price quote for Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoins and convert to USD/GBP/EUR. Enter the number of coins that you want to convert and select the crypto and fiat currencies that you would like to see.

This project uses HTML/CSS/Bootstrap on the front end and JS/Node/Express on the backend. This runs locally on port 3000 and requires express body-parser. The app connects to the BitcoinAverage API using Request. 

$npm install express body-parser request

It was originally derived from a tutorial in [this Udemy Web-Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

2. ## [TinySpritePainter (browswer painting app)](https://github.com/jnees/web-dev-for-fun/tree/master/TinySpritePainter)

Create your low-res masterpiece in this 8x8 pixel art app.

This project uses **html, css/bootstrap, and javascript/jquery**. I was inspired to build this app by my two-year old son who loves both art and trying to click the trackpad on my laptop.

1. ## [Simon (browser game)](https://github.com/jnees/web-dev-for-fun/tree/master/Simon)

Are you a master of memorization? Do you have 'total recall'? Baby, you'll wish you had three brains in this classic memory challenge. Watch the computer display a series of colors, then repeat the buttons back in the same order to advance to the next level.

This project uses **html, css and javascript/jquery** and was inspired by the jquery 'boss level challenge' in [this Udemy Web-Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
