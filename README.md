# web-dev-for-fun
A collection of web development projects that I've built for practice, tutorials, or just for fun.

Are you a master of memorization? Do you have Total Recall? Baby, you'll wish you had three brains in this classic memory challenge. Watch the computer display a series of colors, then repeat the buttons back in the same order to advance to the next level.

This project uses html, css and javascript/jquery and was based on a 'boss level challenge' from [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).
